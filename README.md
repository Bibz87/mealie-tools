## ❔ Why

After using [Mealie](https://github.com/mealie-recipes/mealie) and its API for a
while, I noticed that a lot of what I wanted to do with Mealie could be
automated using scripts. These save time and reduce human input error to a
minimum.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

These scripts were meant to be used and then thrown away. They were never
intended to be clean and reusable code. While they can be used as a starting
point, there are several changes required to make them stable, secure and robust
and these are outside the scope of this project.
